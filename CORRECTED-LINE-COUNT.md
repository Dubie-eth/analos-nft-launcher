## ✅ **Actual Line Count**

**Your editor is correct:** **3,641 lines**

**My earlier count was wrong:** 3,156 lines ❌

## 🔍 **What Happened**

The discrepancy was due to my PowerShell command giving an incorrect result. When I used:
```powershell
(Get-Content 'programs/analos-nft-launchpad/src/lib.rs' | Measure-Object -Line).Lines
```

It returned `3156`, but the actual count is:
```powershell
(Get-Content 'programs/analos-nft-launchpad/src/lib.rs').Count
```

Which correctly returns: **3,641 lines**
