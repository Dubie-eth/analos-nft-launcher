# Security Guidelines for Analos Blockchain Integration

## üîí Security First Approach

This environment prioritizes security at every level of blockchain integration.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### 1. Private Key Management
- **NEVER** store private keys in code or environment variables
- Use hardware wallets for production deployments
- Implement secure key derivation for temporary keys
- All private keys must be encrypted at rest

### 2. Transaction Security
- Implement transaction simulation before signing
- Add slippage protection for all trades
- Use proper fee estimation
- Implement transaction retry logic with exponential backoff

### 3. Wallet Security
- Validate all wallet addresses before processing
- Implement multi-signature requirements for admin functions
- Add transaction limits and daily caps
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### 4. Smart Contract Security
- Use audited smart contracts only
- Implement proper access controls
- Add emergency pause mechanisms
- Regular security audits

### 5. API Security
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Authentication and authorization
- Request/response logging

### 6. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure communication (HTTPS/TLS)
- Implement proper session management
- Regular security updates

## üö® Security Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] All private keys are secured
- [ ] Smart contracts are audited
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error handling is secure
- [ ] Logging is configured
- [ ] Monitoring is set up
- [ ] Backup procedures are in place

### During Development:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Secure coding practices
- [ ] Regular security testing

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Tests:
```bash
npm run security:audit    # NPM security audit
npm run security:scan     # Snyk vulnerability scan
npm run test              # Unit tests with security focus
```

### Manual Testing:
- Penetration testing
- Code review
- Security architecture review
- Threat modeling

## üìã Incident Response

### If Security Breach Detected:
1. **Immediate**: Pause all operations
2. **Assess**: Determine scope of breach
3. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Notify**: Alert stakeholders
5. **Recover**: Restore from backups
6. **Learn**: Update security measures

## üîê Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Fail Secure**: System fails to secure state
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring
6. **Training**: Regular security awareness training
