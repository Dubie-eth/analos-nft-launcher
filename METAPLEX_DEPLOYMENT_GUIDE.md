# üöÄ Metaplex Token Metadata Program Deployment Guide
## Deploy to Analos Blockchain via Solana Playground

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Analos wallet with sufficient LOS for deployment (~5-10 LOS recommended)
- Access to Solana Playground (https://beta.solpg.io)

---

## üéØ **Step-by-Step Deployment Process**

### **Step 1: Open Solana Playground**
1. Go to: **https://beta.solpg.io**
2. You'll see the Solana Playground interface

### **Step 2: Import Metaplex Program from GitHub**
1. Click on the **folder icon** (Explorer) in the left sidebar
2. Click on **"Create a new project"** or use the existing one
3. In the file explorer, right-click and select **"Import from GitHub"**
4. Enter this GitHub URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata
   ```
5. Select the **`programs/token-metadata/program`** directory
6. Click **"Import"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative if GitHub import doesn't work:**
Since the program is already on your PC at:
`C:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\LosLauncher\metaplex-standalone`

We can manually upload the files (but this will take time due to the number of files).

---

### **Step 3: Configure for Analos Network**

1. In Solana Playground, click on the **gear icon** (Settings) at the bottom left
2. Under **"Endpoint"**, select **"Custom"**
3. Enter the Analos RPC URL:
   ```
   https://analos.rpcpool.com/
   ```
4. Click **"Save"**

---

### **Step 4: Connect Your Wallet**

1. Click on the **wallet icon** at the bottom left
2. Select **"Connect Wallet"**
3. Choose your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
4. Approve the connection

**üí∞ Make sure your wallet has at least 5-10 LOS for deployment fees!**

---

### **Step 5: Build the Program**

1. In the terminal at the bottom of Solana Playground, run:
   ```bash
   build
   ```
2. Wait for the build to complete (this may take 2-5 minutes)
3. You should see: **"Build successful"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you get errors:**
- Make sure all files were imported correctly
- Check that the `Cargo.toml` is present
- Try running `build` again

---

### **Step 6: Deploy to Analos**

1. After a successful build, run:
   ```bash
   deploy
   ```
2. **Approve the transaction** in your wallet when prompted
3. Wait for deployment to complete (may take 1-3 minutes)
4. You'll see output like:
   ```
   Program Id: <YOUR_PROGRAM_ID_HERE>
   ```

**üéâ SAVE THIS PROGRAM ID! You'll need it for the backend!**

Example Program ID format: `metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s`

---

### **Step 7: Verify Deployment**

1. Copy the Program ID from the deployment output
2. Go to the Analos Explorer:
   ```
   https://explorer.analos.com/address/<YOUR_PROGRAM_ID>
   ```
3. You should see the program details

---

## üîß **After Deployment: Update Backend**

Once you have the Program ID, we need to update the backend code:

1. Open: `backend/src/real-nft-minting-service.ts`
2. Find the line with `TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID`
3. Replace it with your new Program ID:
   ```typescript
   const TOKEN_METADATA_PROGRAM_ID = publicKey('YOUR_NEW_PROGRAM_ID_HERE');
   ```
4. Save the file
5. Restart the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

---

## üé® **Test NFT Minting**

After updating the backend:

1. Go to: **https://analos-nft-launcher-9cxc.vercel.app/mint-real-nft**
2. Connect your wallet
3. Fill in NFT details
4. Click **"Mint Real NFT"**
5. Approve the transaction
6. Check the Analos Explorer for your new NFT!

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Build Fails**
- Make sure all source files are present
- Check that `Cargo.toml` is correct
- Try refreshing Solana Playground and rebuilding

### **Deployment Fails**
- Check wallet balance (need 5-10 LOS)
- Make sure you're connected to Analos network
- Try deploying again (sometimes network issues occur)

### **"Program already exists" Error**
- The Program ID is already in use
- Generate a new keypair in Solana Playground:
  ```bash
  solana-keygen new -o program-keypair.json
  ```
- Try deploying again

---

## üìä **Expected Costs**

- **Build**: Free (happens in browser)
- **Deployment**: ~2-5 LOS (depends on program size)
- **Total**: ~5-10 LOS (to be safe)

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Checklist**

- [ ] Solana Playground opened
- [ ] Metaplex program imported
- [ ] Analos RPC configured
- [ ] Wallet connected with sufficient LOS
- [ ] Program built successfully
- [ ] Program deployed successfully
- [ ] Program ID saved
- [ ] Backend updated with new Program ID
- [ ] Backend restarted
- [ ] NFT minting tested

---

## üéØ **Next Steps After Successful Deployment**

1. ‚úÖ Update backend with Program ID
2. ‚úÖ Deploy backend to Railway
3. ‚úÖ Test NFT minting on production
4. ‚úÖ Update frontend to use production backend
5. ‚úÖ Deploy frontend to Vercel
6. ‚úÖ Test full flow end-to-end

---

**üéâ Once this is done, you'll have REAL NFTs on Analos!**
