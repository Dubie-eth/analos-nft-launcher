## 🎯 Next Steps (REQUIRED)

### **Step 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment** ⏳
Vercel is currently deploying your fix. This takes about 2-3 minutes.

**Check deployment status:**
https://vercel.com/dubie-eths-projects/analos_nft_frontend_minimal

**Look for:**
- ✅ Green checkmark = Deployment successful
- 🔴 Red X = Deployment failed (check logs)

---

### **Step 2: Initialize Price Oracle** 🚀

Once Vercel deployment shows ✅ green:

1. **Open your production admin panel:**
   - Find your Vercel URL in the dashboard
   - Add `/admin` to the end
   - Example: `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin`

2. **Connect your admin wallet:**
   - Click wallet button (top right)
   - Connect the wallet that deployed the Price Oracle program
   - Must have ~0.001 LOS for fees

3. **Navigate to Price Oracle tab:**
   - Look for the tab with 💰 icon
   - Click "Price Oracle"

4. **Enter market cap:**
   - Recommended: `1000000` (= $1M USD)
   - Or choose your preferred value
   - This is the TOTAL market cap for LOS token

5. **Click "Initialize Price Oracle":**
   - Review transaction details
   - Sign with your wallet
   - Wait for confirmation (~2-5 seconds)

6. **Success! ✅**
   - You'll see transaction signature
   - Link to explorer
   - Oracle is now active!
