## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Simple
Test with ONE program first (e.g., OTC Enhanced), then add others.

### Tip 2: Use Devnet
Test on devnet before mainnet:
```typescript
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
```

### Tip 3: Check Program Health
```bash
solana program show <PROGRAM_ID>
```

### Tip 4: Cache IDL Files
Store IDL files in git to avoid re-downloading.

### Tip 5: Error Handling
Always wrap program calls in try-catch:
```typescript
try {
  await program.methods.someFunction().rpc();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error);
}
```

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't try to build Rust programs locally** (they're deployed!)
2. **Don't modify program IDs** (use existing ones)
3. **Don't skip getting IDL files** (required for frontend)
4. **Don't test on mainnet first** (use devnet)
5. **Don't commit private keys** (use environment variables)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

You'll know you're successful when:

1. ✅ All 5 IDL files are in `idl/` directory
2. ✅ `programs.ts` loads without errors
3. ✅ Can call at least one program function
