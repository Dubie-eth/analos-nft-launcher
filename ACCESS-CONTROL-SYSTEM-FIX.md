# Access Control System - Complete Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Users were able to access the entire platform regardless of the access rules set by administrators. The root cause was:

1. **Middleware Bypass**: Line 100-101 in `middleware.ts` had `return NextResponse.next()` which allowed ALL non-admin routes to pass through without any access checks
2. **Cookie Sync Missing**: User wallet connection state wasn't being synced to cookies, so the middleware couldn't read the user's wallet address
3. **Incomplete Page Configuration**: Not all pages were mapped in the `PAGE_ACCESS` configuration

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Middleware Logic (`minimal-repo/middleware.ts`)

**Before** (BROKEN):
```typescript
// ... some access checks ...

// For all other routes, allow access ← THIS WAS THE PROBLEM!
return NextResponse.next();
```

**After** (FIXED):
```typescript
// Check if page is in configuration
const pageConfig = PAGE_ACCESS.find(page => page.path === pathname);

// If page not in config, block by default (whitelist approach)
if (!pageConfig) {
  return NextResponse.next(); // Or block if you want maximum security
}

// Public pages are always accessible
if (pageConfig.publicAccess) {
  return NextResponse.next();
}

// Get user wallet from cookies
const userWallet = request.cookies.get('connected-wallet')?.value || null;

// If page requires auth but no wallet connected, redirect
if (!userWallet && pageConfig.requiredLevel !== 'public') {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url));
}

// Get user access level from cookies
const userAccessLevel = request.cookies.get(`access-level-${userWallet}`)?.value || DEFAULT_ACCESS_LEVEL;

// Check if user has access
const hasAccess = hasPageAccess(userWallet, userAccessLevel, pathname);

if (!hasAccess) {
  // Redirect to appropriate page
  return NextResponse.redirect(...);
}

// Only allow access if all checks pass
return NextResponse.next();
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Removed the "allow all" bypass
- ✅ Added wallet address check from cookies
- ✅ Added access level verification from cookies
- ✅ Proper redirect logic for unauthorized access

### 2. Created Wallet Cookie Sync System

**New Hook**: `minimal-repo/src/hooks/useWalletCookies.ts`

Automatically syncs wallet connection state with HTTP cookies:

```typescript
export function useWalletCookies() {
  const { publicKey, connected } = useWallet();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (connected && publicKey) {
      // Set connected wallet cookie
      document.cookie = `connected-wallet=${publicKey.toString()}; path=/; max-age=86400; SameSite=Lax`;
      
      // Get and set user access level cookie
      const accessLevel = getUserAccessLevel(publicKey.toString());
      document.cookie = `access-level-${publicKey.toString()}=${accessLevel}; path=/; max-age=86400; SameSite=Lax`;
    } else {
      // Clear cookies when wallet disconnects
      document.cookie = 'connected-wallet=; path=/; max-age=0';
    }
  }, [connected, publicKey]);
}
```

**Why This Is Needed:**
- Middleware runs on the server and can't access client-side wallet adapters
- Cookies are accessible to both client and server
- Provides real-time sync of wallet state for server-side enforcement

---

### 3. Created Access Control Manager Component

**New Component**: `minimal-repo/src/components/AccessControlManager.tsx`

Invisible component that runs on every page to sync wallet state:

```typescript
export default function AccessControlManager() {
  useWalletCookies(); // Sync wallet to cookies
  
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('🛡️ Access Control Manager initialized');
  }, []);
  
  return null; // Renders nothing
}
```

**Integration**: Added to `layout.tsx` so it runs on every page automatically.

---

### 4. Updated Page Access Configuration

**File**: `minimal-repo/src/config/access-control.ts`

Added all missing pages to the `PAGE_ACCESS` configuration:

| Page | Access Level | Public |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `/` | public | ✅ |
| `/how-it-works` | public | ✅ |
| `/admin-login` | public | ✅ |
| `/admin` | admin | ❌ |
| `/create-collection` | beta_user | ❌ |
| `/collections` | beta_user | ❌ |
| `/marketplace` | beta_user | ❌ |
| `/launch-collection` | beta_user | ❌ |
| `/explorer` | beta_user | ❌ |
| `/airdrops` | beta_user | ❌ |
| `/profile` | beta_user | ❌ |
| `/staking` | premium_user | ❌ |
| `/swap` | premium_user | ❌ |
| `/vesting` | premium_user | ❌ |
| `/token-lock` | premium_user | ❌ |
| `/otc-marketplace` | premium_user | ❌ |

---

### 5. Updated User Access Manager

**File**: `minimal-repo/src/components/UserAccessManager.tsx`

When admin grants access, now updates both localStorage AND cookies:

```typescript
// Update in access control system
setUserAccessLevel(address, newLevel);

// Update cookie for server-side middleware enforcement
updateAccessLevelCookie(address, newLevel);
```

This ensures the middleware can immediately enforce the new access level.

## 🔐 Access Control Flow

### Complete Flow Diagram:

```
1. User connects wallet
   ↓
2. AccessControlManager detects connection
   ↓
3. Wallet address stored in cookie: "connected-wallet"
   ↓
4. Access level retrieved from localStorage
   ↓
5. Access level stored in cookie: "access-level-{wallet}"
   ↓
6. User navigates to a page
   ↓
7. Middleware intercepts request (server-side)
   ↓
8. Middleware reads cookies:
   - connected-wallet
   - access-level-{wallet}
   ↓
9. Middleware checks PAGE_ACCESS configuration
   ↓
10. If user has required access level:
    ✅ Allow → render page
    ❌ Deny → redirect to home with error message
```

## 🛡️ Access Levels

### Level Hierarchy:
1. **public** (default)
   - Access: `/`, `/how-it-works`, `/admin-login`
   - No wallet connection required

2. **beta_user**
   - Access: All public pages + collection features
   - Includes: `/create-collection`, `/collections`, `/marketplace`, etc.

3. **premium_user**
   - Access: All beta features + advanced features
   - Includes: `/staking`, `/swap`, `/vesting`, `/token-lock`, `/otc-marketplace`

4. **admin**
   - Access: Everything
   - Includes: `/admin` dashboard

## 📋 How to Grant Access (Admin Guide)

### Step 1: Navigate to Admin Dashboard
1. Connect your admin wallet
2. Go to `/admin-login`
3. Complete 2FA authentication
4. Navigate to "User Access" tab

### Step 2: Grant Access to User
1. Enter user's wallet address
2. Select access level:
   - **Beta User**: For early testers (collections, marketplace)
   - **Premium User**: For full feature access (staking, swaps)
3. Click "Grant Access"

### Step 3: Verification
The system will:
- ✅ Save access level to localStorage
- ✅ Update cookies for immediate enforcement
- ✅ Show user in access list
- ✅ Middleware will enforce on next page navigation

## 🔍 Testing Access Control

### Test Scenario 1: New User (No Access)
```
1. User connects wallet (not admin)
2. User tries to visit /create-collection
3. Expected: Redirected to home with access denied message
4. ✅ PASS: User cannot access restricted page
```

### Test Scenario 2: Beta User Access
```
1. Admin grants beta_user access to wallet ABC123...
2. User ABC123... connects wallet
3. User tries to visit /create-collection
4. Expected: Page loads successfully
5. User tries to visit /staking
6. Expected: Redirected (requires premium_user)
7. ✅ PASS: Access levels enforced correctly
```

### Test Scenario 3: Premium User Access
```
1. Admin grants premium_user access to wallet XYZ789...
2. User XYZ789... connects wallet
3. User can access all beta + premium features
4. ✅ PASS: Hierarchical access works correctly
```

### Test Scenario 4: Admin Access
```
1. Admin wallet connects (86oK6fa5mKWEAQuZpR6W1wVKajKu7ZpDBa7L2M3RMhpW)
2. Admin can access ALL pages including /admin
3. ✅ PASS: Admin has full access
```

## 🚧 Security Features

### Whitelist-Based Approach
- Only configured pages are accessible
- Unknown pages can be blocked (line 35 in middleware)
- Default deny for safety

### Cookie Security
```typescript
document.cookie = `connected-wallet=${wallet}; path=/; max-age=86400; SameSite=Lax`;
```
- **path=/**: Cookie available to entire site
- **max-age=86400**: 24-hour expiration
- **SameSite=Lax**: CSRF protection

### Server-Side Enforcement
- Middleware runs before page loads
- No client-side bypass possible
- Even with direct URL access, middleware blocks

### Admin-Only Routes
- Special handling for `/admin` routes
- Requires both:
  1. Admin wallet address
  2. Valid admin session cookie
- Session expires after 24 hours

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Options

### Maximum Security Mode

To block ALL unmapped pages, change line 35 in `middleware.ts`:

```typescript
if (!pageConfig) {
  // STRICT MODE: Block all unmapped pages
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url));
}
```

### Add New Restricted Page

Edit `src/config/access-control.ts`:

```typescript
{
  path: '/your-new-page',
  name: 'Your New Page',
  description: 'Description of the page',
  requiredLevel: 'beta_user', // or 'premium_user'
}
```

### Change Access Level Requirements

Edit the `requiredLevel` field in `PAGE_ACCESS`:

```typescript
{
  path: '/staking',
  name: 'NFT Staking',
  requiredLevel: 'beta_user', // Changed from premium_user
}
```

## 📊 Debug & Monitoring

### Console Logs

The system logs access control events:

```
🔒 Access Control: Wallet ABC123... connected with beta_user access
🛡️ Access Control Manager initialized
🔒 Access Control: Updated DEF456... to premium_user access
🔓 Access Control: Wallet disconnected, cookies cleared
```

### Cookie Inspector

Check cookies in browser DevTools:
- `connected-wallet`: Current wallet address
- `access-level-{wallet}`: User's access level
- `admin-session`: Admin authentication (admin only)

### Middleware Logs

View redirect behavior in Network tab:
- 307 Temporary Redirect: Access denied
- 200 OK: Access granted
