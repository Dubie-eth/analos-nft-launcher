Once you've completed the basic tests above and confirmed everything works:

### **Phase 2: Deploy First Collection**
1. Fill out Launch Collection form
2. Click "Launch Collection"
3. Sign transaction
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Verify collection appears in marketplace

2. Click "Mint"
3. Sign transaction
4. Verify NFT appears in profile

### **Phase 4: Initialize Price Oracle**

## 📊 **WHAT TO LOOK FOR**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- Wallet connects without errors
- All pages load correctly
- Health checks pass (except Price Oracle data warning - expected)
- Backend endpoints respond
- Console logs show successful RPC calls
- No TypeScript errors
- No CORS errors

### **⚠️ Expected Warnings:**
- **Price Oracle data not found:** Normal - needs initialization
- **No collections found:** Normal - none deployed yet
- **Empty profile:** Normal - no NFTs owned yet
- **Missing favicon:** Cosmetic only

### **❌ Real Errors to Report:**
- Cannot connect wallet
- Health check fails completely
- Backend endpoints timeout
- CORS errors
- TypeScript errors in console
- RPC connection fails

---

## 🆘 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Wallet Won't Connect:**
1. Make sure you have a Solana wallet extension installed
2. Try refreshing the page
3. Try a different wallet (Backpack, Phantom, or Solflare)
4. Check that your wallet is on the correct network (Analos/Custom RPC)

### **If Admin Page Shows "Admin Access Required":**
This is normal! Your wallet address needs to be added to the admin list. Just let me know your address and we'll add it.

### **If Backend Tests Fail:**
Check the Railway backend logs to see if the service is running properly.

### **If RPC Calls Fail:**
Verify that `https://rpc.analos.io` is accessible.
