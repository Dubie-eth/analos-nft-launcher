# ✅ TypeScript Error Fixed!

## 🐛 **The Error**

```
Type error: Cannot find name 'signature'.
  171 |         programId: ANALOS_PROGRAMS.PRICE_ORACLE.toString(),
  172 |         pdaAddress: priceOraclePda.toString(),
> 173 |         signature: signature
      |                    ^
```

---

## 🔧 **The Fix**

The issue was that `signature` was declared **inside** the try-catch block within the for loop, but was being used **outside** that scope after the loop completed.

### **Before:**
```typescript
let success = false;
let lastError = null;

for (const { name, discriminator } of discriminators) {
  try {
    // ... code ...
    const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(...);
    // signature only exists in this scope
    success = true;
    break;
  } catch (error) {
    // ...
  }
}

// ❌ ERROR: signature is not defined here!
const oracleData = {
  signature: signature  // Can't find 'signature'
};
```

### **After:**
```typescript
let success = false;
let lastError = null;
let finalSignature: string = '';  // ✅ Declared at proper scope

for (const { name, discriminator } of discriminators) {
  try {
    // ... code ...
    const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(...);
    finalSignature = signature;  // ✅ Store it in the outer scope variable
    success = true;
    break;
  } catch (error) {
    // ...
  }
}

// ✅ Now finalSignature is available!
const oracleData = {
  signature: finalSignature  // Works perfectly!
};
```

## 📦 **Changes Made**

### **File:** `src/components/PriceOracleInitializer.tsx`

1. **Added `finalSignature` declaration:**
   ```typescript
   let finalSignature: string = '';
   ```

2. **Store signature when successful:**
   ```typescript
   finalSignature = signature;
   ```

3. **Use `finalSignature` in oracleData:**
   ```typescript
   signature: finalSignature
   ```

4. **Use `finalSignature` in setResult:**
   ```typescript
   signature: finalSignature
   ```

## ✅ **Status**

- ✅ TypeScript error fixed
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Committed to git
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Vercel deployment will trigger automatically

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

The fix has been deployed! Vercel will automatically:
1. Pull the latest code
2. Build the frontend
3. Deploy to production

**In 2-3 minutes, your site will be live with the fix!** 🎉

---

## 📋 **Summary**

**Problem:** Variable scope issue - `signature` was declared inside a loop but used outside of it.

**Solution:** Created `finalSignature` variable at the correct scope level and stored the signature value in it.

**Result:** TypeScript compilation now succeeds, and Vercel deployment will complete successfully!
