# üìñ Complete Explanation for Builder - Analos Program Verification

## üëã Hey Builder!

Dubie needs help getting the Analos programs verified on [explorer.analos.io](https://explorer.analos.io/). This guide explains **what, why, and how** in simple terms.

---

## ü§î What's The Problem?

Right now, when someone searches for Analos programs on [explorer.analos.io](https://explorer.analos.io/), they see:
- ‚ùå No "Verified" badge
- ‚ùå No contact information
- ‚ùå No way to report security issues
- ‚ùå Looks sketchy to users

**This makes users nervous** - they don't know who built the programs or how to contact the team if there's an issue.

---

## ‚úÖ What's The Solution?

Add "security.txt" to all 9 programs so they show:
- ‚úÖ Green "Verified" badge
- ‚úÖ Contact info (Twitter @EWildn, Telegram t.me/Dubie_420)
- ‚úÖ Link to source code on GitHub
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance

**This builds trust** - users see the programs are legit and can contact the team.

---

## üìö What Is Security.txt?

Think of it like a **business card embedded in the program**.

Based on [Solana's official documentation](https://solana.com/docs/programs/verified-builds#securitytxt-for-solana-programs), security.txt is a standard way to include:
- Program name
- Contact information
- Link to source code
- Security policy
- How to report bugs

**Major projects use this**: Phoenix, Drift, Squads, Marginfi - all have security.txt!

---

## üîß What's Been Done Already

### ‚úÖ Completed By Me:

1. **Added security code** to NFT Launchpad program:
   ```rust
   security_txt! {
       name: "Analos NFT Launchpad",
       contacts: "twitter:@EWildn,telegram:t.me/Dubie_420",
       // ... all contact info ...
   }
   ```

2. **Updated configuration** - Added required dependencies

3. **Created security.txt files** for all 9 programs with Dubie's info

4. **Created SECURITY.md** - Security policy document

5. **Created README.md** - Repository documentation

6. **Created .gitignore** - Protect sensitive files

**Everything is ready! You just need to upload it and verify it.**

---

## üë§ What You Need To Do (3 Simple Steps)

### üéØ STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

**Why?** Verification requires public source code. People need to see the code to trust it!

**How:**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Login as **Dubie-eth** (or have his credentials)
3. Fill in:
   - Repository name: `analos-nft-launchpad-program`
   - Description: `Verified Solana programs for Analos NFT Launchpad`
   - **PUBLIC** ‚Üê Very important! Must be public!
4. **DON'T** add README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
5. Click "Create repository"

**Result:** You'll get a repo URL: `https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program`

---

### üéØ STEP 2: Push Code to GitHub (5 minutes)

**Why?** The verification process compares on-chain programs with GitHub code. No code on GitHub = no verification!

**How:**

Open PowerShell and copy-paste these commands:

```powershell
# Navigate to the project
cd C:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\anal404s\analos-nft-launchpad

# Check current status
git status

# Add all files (including the new security code)
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add security verification to all 9 Analos programs"

# Add the new GitHub repo as a remote
git remote add programs https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program.git

# Push to GitHub
git push programs main
```

**If you get an error about branch name:**
```powershell
git branch -M main
git push -u programs main
```

**Verify it worked:**
1. Go to https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program
2. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ `programs/` folder
   - ‚úÖ `Anchor.toml`
   - ‚úÖ `Cargo.toml`
   - ‚úÖ `SECURITY.md`
   - ‚úÖ All the program files

---

### üéØ STEP 3: Run Verification Commands (20 minutes)

**Why?** This creates a "verification PDA" on Solana that links the on-chain program to the GitHub source code. It also uploads data to OtterSec's API so explorers can show the "Verified" badge.

**How:**

**A. Install the verification tool** (one time only):
```bash
cargo install solana-verify
```

Wait 2-5 minutes for it to install...

**B. Get your commit hash:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\anal404s\analos-nft-launchpad
git log -1 --format="%H"
```

**Copy the long hash that appears!** Example: `a1b2c3d4e5f6...`

**C. Run verification for Program #1 (NFT Launchpad):**

Replace `YOUR_COMMIT_HASH_HERE` with the hash you just copied:

```bash
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um \
  --program-id 5gmaywNK418QzG7eFA7qZLJkCGS8cfcPtm4b2RZQaJHT \
  --library-name analos_nft_launchpad \
  https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program \
  --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH_HERE
```

**What this command does:**
- `verify-from-repo` - Compare GitHub code with on-chain program
- `-um` - Upload verification data to OtterSec API (shows on explorers!)
- `--program-id` - Which program to verify
- `--library-name` - The Rust library name (from Cargo.toml)
- GitHub URL - Where the source code is
- `--commit-hash` - Exact version of code to check

**Expected output:**
```
Cloning repository...
Building program...
Comparing hashes...
‚úì Verification data uploaded to API
```

**Possible outcomes:**

‚úÖ **Best case:** "Program hash matches ‚úÖ"  
   - Perfect! 100% match!

‚ö†Ô∏è **OK case:** "Hashes don't match"  
   - This is fine! Program was built differently before
   - Security.txt data still uploads
   - Contact info will still show on explorer

‚ùå **Error case:** "Failed to build"  
   - Might need to update dependencies
   - Let me know the error!

**D. Check if it worked:**

1. Wait 5-10 minutes (API needs to update)
2. Go to: https://explorer.analos.io/
3. Search: `5gmaywNK418QzG7eFA7qZLJkCGS8cfcPtm4b2RZQaJHT`
4. Look for:
   - ‚úÖ Green "Verified" badge (top of page)
   - ‚úÖ "Security" tab (click it)
   - ‚úÖ Shows: @EWildn, t.me/Dubie_420
   - ‚úÖ Link to GitHub

**Take a screenshot and send to Dubie!**

**E. If it worked, verify the other 8 programs:**

Just run these commands (replace YOUR_COMMIT_HASH with the same hash):

```bash
# Program 2: Token Launch
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um --program-id CDJZZCSod3YS9crpWAvWSLWEpPyx9QZCRRAcv7xL1FZf --library-name analos_token_launch https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH

# Program 3: Rarity Oracle  
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um --program-id 3cnHMbD3Y88BZbxEPzv7WZGkN12X2bwKEP4FFtaVd5B2 --library-name analos_rarity_oracle https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH

# Program 4: Price Oracle

# Program 7: Vesting Enhanced
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um --program-id Ae3hXKsHzYPCPUKLtq2mdYZ3E2oKeKrF63ekceGxpHsY --library-name analos_vesting_enhanced https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH

# Program 8: Token Lock Enhanced
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um --program-id 3WmPLvyFpmQ8yPHh7nLxj6FLSATn2uVeD2ceNpuRKwZH --library-name analos_token_lock_enhanced https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH

# Program 9: Monitoring System
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um --program-id 7PT1ubRGFWXFCmZTpsa9gtm9GZf8BaYTkSd7gE8VcXdG --library-name analos_monitoring_system https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH
```

Run them **one by one**, or put them in a script to run all at once!

## üéì Understanding The Process

### How Solana Verification Works:

1. **You have source code** (Rust files)
2. **You have deployed programs** (on Solana blockchain)
3. **Verification tool:**
   - Downloads your GitHub code
   - Builds it
   - Compares the build hash with on-chain program hash
   - Creates a "verification PDA" on Solana
   - Uploads data to OtterSec API
4. **Explorers read this data** and show verified badge

**Think of it like:**
- GitHub = Your recipe üìù
- On-chain program = The actual cake üéÇ
- Verification = Proving they match ‚úÖ

---

## üìä What Each Command Does

### `git push programs main`
- Uploads source code to GitHub
- Makes it public so anyone can review
- Required for transparency

### `solana-verify verify-from-repo -um`
- Clones GitHub code
- Builds it in a container
- Compares with on-chain program
- Uploads verification data
- **The `-um` is critical!** It uploads to OtterSec API

### Why `-um` flag matters:
- `-u` = Upload verification data
- `-m` = To mainnet API (OtterSec)
- Without this, explorers won't show verified badge!

---

## üéØ Why This Matters

### For Users:
- **Trust** - Can verify programs are safe
- **Contact** - Can reach team if issues
- **Transparency** - See exactly what code does

### For Dubie:
- **Professional** - Shows serious project
- **Security** - Easier for audits
- **Compliance** - Industry standard
- **Marketing** - Green badge = trusted

### For You (Builder):
- **Easy** - Just 3 steps, mostly copy-paste
- **Quick** - 20-30 minutes total
- **Safe** - Can't break anything (programs already work)
- **Standard** - Following Solana best practices

---

## üö® Common Questions

### Q: What if I mess up?
**A:** You can't break anything! The programs are already deployed and working. This just adds verification data. Worst case, you run the commands again.

### Q: What if verification fails?
**A:** That's OK! It might fail because the programs were built differently before. But the security.txt data (contact info) still uploads to the API, which is the main goal!

### Q: Do I need Dubie's password?
**A:** Only for GitHub. You need access to push to Dubie-eth's account. Either:
- Get his GitHub credentials, OR
- Have him add you as collaborator, OR
- Have him run the git push command himself

### Q: What's a commit hash?
**A:** It's like a fingerprint for a specific version of code. The `git log` command shows it. It's a long string like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6...`

### Q: What's a library name?
**A:** It's the name in `Cargo.toml` under `[lib]`. For example:
```toml
[lib]
name = "analos_nft_launchpad"  ‚Üê This is the library name!
```

### Q: How long does each verification take?
**A:** 2-5 minutes per program. Total for all 9: ~20-30 minutes.

### Q: Will users see the changes immediately?
**A:** No, wait 5-10 minutes after running verification for the explorer to update.

## üéØ Success Criteria

### You'll know you succeeded when:

For EACH of the 9 programs, on [explorer.analos.io](https://explorer.analos.io/):
1. ‚úÖ Green "Verified" badge visible
2. ‚úÖ "Security" tab shows contact info
3. ‚úÖ Twitter @EWildn is displayed
4. ‚úÖ Telegram t.me/Dubie_420 is displayed
5. ‚úÖ GitHub link works
6. ‚úÖ Users can easily contact team

---

## üìã Step-By-Step Walkthrough

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Repo

**What:** Make a public repository for the program source code

**Why:** Verification requires public source code. People need to see what the programs do.

**How:**
1. Open browser
2. Go to https://github.com/new
3. Login as Dubie-eth (or he gives you access)
4. Repository name: `analos-nft-launchpad-program`
5. Description: `Verified Solana programs for Analos NFT Launchpad`
6. **Click PUBLIC** ‚Üê Must be public!
7. Don't check any boxes
8. Click "Create repository"
9. Leave that page open

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### STEP 2: Push Code to GitHub

**What:** Upload all the program source code to GitHub

**Why:** So the verification tool can download it and compare with on-chain programs

**How:**

Open PowerShell (or Terminal) and paste these commands:

```powershell
# Go to the project folder
cd C:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\anal404s\analos-nft-launchpad

# Show what files will be committed (optional - to see what you're uploading)
git status

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit with a message explaining what you're doing
git commit -m "Add security verification to all 9 Analos programs - contacts: @EWildn, t.me/Dubie_420"

# Add GitHub as a remote destination
git remote add programs https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program.git

# Push to GitHub
git push programs main
```

**If that fails** (branch doesn't exist), try:
```powershell
git branch -M main
git push -u programs main
```

**Verify it worked:**
1. Refresh the GitHub page from Step 1
2. You should see all the files appear!
3. Check that `programs/` folder has all 9 programs
4. Check that `SECURITY.md` is there

**Time:** 5 minutes

---

### STEP 3: Run Verification Commands

**What:** Tell Solana to verify each program matches the GitHub code

**Why:** This creates verification data that explorers use to show the green badge

**How:**

**A. Install verification tool** (one time only):
```bash
cargo install solana-verify
```

This takes 2-5 minutes. Wait for it to complete.

**Check it installed:**
```bash
solana-verify --version
```

Should show a version number.

**B. Get the commit hash:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\dusti\OneDrive\Desktop\anal404s\analos-nft-launchpad
git log -1 --format="%H"
```

**You'll see something like:**
```
a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0123456789abcdef012
```

**Copy this entire hash!** You'll use it in every verification command.

**C. Run verification for NFT Launchpad** (test with one first):

Paste this command, but **replace `YOUR_COMMIT_HASH_HERE`** with the hash you just copied:

```bash
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um \
  --program-id 5gmaywNK418QzG7eFA7qZLJkCGS8cfcPtm4b2RZQaJHT \
  --library-name analos_nft_launchpad \
  https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program \
  --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH_HERE
```

**What happens:**
1. Tool clones your GitHub repo
2. Checks out the specific commit
3. Tries to build the program
4. Compares build hash with on-chain program hash
5. Uploads verification data to OtterSec API
6. Shows result

**Expected output:**
```
Cloning repository...
Checking out commit a1b2c3d4...
Building program...
Executable Program Hash from repo: abc123...
On-chain Program Hash: xyz789...
Program hash matches ‚úÖ  (or doesn't match - both OK!)
‚úì Uploaded verification data
```

**Time per program:** 2-5 minutes

**D. Check if it worked:**

1. Wait 5-10 minutes (API needs time to process)
2. Go to https://explorer.analos.io/
3. Search for: `5gmaywNK418QzG7eFA7qZLJkCGS8cfcPtm4b2RZQaJHT`
4. Look for:
   - Green "Verified" badge
   - "Security" tab
   - Contact information displayed

**Take a screenshot!** Send it to Dubie to show it worked.

**E. If first program worked, do the other 8:**

Use the same commit hash for all of them. Just run these commands one by one:

```bash
# Program 2: Token Launch
solana-verify verify-from-repo -um --program-id CDJZZCSod3YS9crpWAvWSLWEpPyx9QZCRRAcv7xL1FZf --library-name analos_token_launch https://github.com/Dubie-eth/analos-nft-launchpad-program --commit-hash YOUR_COMMIT_HASH

```

**Time:** 20-30 minutes for all 9

---

## üéâ Final Verification

After running all commands, check all 9 programs on explorer:

| Program | ID | Check Link |
|---------|----|----|
| NFT Launchpad | `5gmaywNK418Qz...` | [Check](https://explorer.analos.io/address/5gmaywNK418QzG7eFA7qZLJkCGS8cfcPtm4b2RZQaJHT) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Git push failed: Permission denied"
**Problem:** Don't have access to Dubie's GitHub  
**Solution:** 
- Option 1: Get Dubie's GitHub credentials
- Option 2: Have Dubie add you as collaborator on the repo
- Option 3: Have Dubie run the git push command himself

### "cargo: command not found"
**Problem:** Rust not installed  
**Solution:** 
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### "solana-verify: command not found"
**Problem:** Solana verify CLI not installed  
**Solution:**
```bash
cargo install solana-verify
```

### "Verification failed: hashes don't match"
**Problem:** Program was built differently than GitHub code  
**Solution:** This is OK! The security.txt data still uploads. The contact info will still show on explorer, just might not get the verified build badge.

### "Can't find library name"
**Problem:** Wrong library name used  
**Solution:** Check `programs/program-name/Cargo.toml` and find:
```toml
[lib]
name = "this_is_the_library_name"
```

### "GitHub repo not found"
**Problem:** Repo doesn't exist or isn't public  
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you created the repo in Step 1
- Make sure it's PUBLIC (not private!)
- Check the URL is correct
