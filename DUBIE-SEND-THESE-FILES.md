## 💬 What To Tell The Builder

### Simple Message:

```
Hey! 

I need help getting our Analos programs verified on explorer.analos.io 
so they show a green "Verified" badge with our contact info.

All the code is ready - you just need to:
1. Create a GitHub repo
2. Push the code 
3. Run verification commands

Should take about 40 minutes total.

I've attached 3 files:
- FOR-BUILDER-FULL-EXPLANATION.md (read this first)
- CHEAT-SHEET.md (commands to run)
- SEND-THIS-TO-BUILDER.md (overview)

My contact info that needs to show:
- Twitter: @EWildn
- Telegram: t.me/Dubie_420

Let me know when it's done! Thanks! 🚀

- Dubie
```

## 🔑 Access They'll Need

### GitHub Access:
The builder needs to push to **YOUR** GitHub account: **Dubie-eth**

**Options:**
1. **Give them your GitHub password** (for this task only)
2. **Add them as collaborator** on the new repo (after they create it)
3. **You run the git push command** and they do the verification

**I recommend Option 3** - You do the git push (2 min), they do the rest!

### What They DON'T Need:
- ❌ Your Solana wallet/keypair
- ❌ Access to deployed programs
- ❌ Ability to modify programs

They're just uploading code and running verification!
