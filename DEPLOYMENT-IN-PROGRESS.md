   // To:
   declare_id!("YOUR_ACTUAL_PROGRAM_ID");
   ```
3. **Build again** - With correct program ID
4. **Export IDL** - Save the IDL JSON file

## ⏭️ Next: Initialize Platform

Once deployed, run this transaction:

```typescript
await program.methods
  .initializePlatform()
  .accounts({
    platformConfig: platformConfigPda,
    admin: wallet.publicKey,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .rpc();
```

This sets up:
- ✅ Your admin wallet
- ✅ Default fee rates (2.5% mint, 5% tokens)
- ✅ Distribution split (40% treasury, 30% holders, 15% dev, 10% marketing, 5% buyback)
- ✅ Platform limits
- ✅ Presale settings

**Stand by for deployment completion!** 🚀
