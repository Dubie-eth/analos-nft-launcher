### **STEP 1: Open Solana Playground**

1. Go to: **https://beta.solpg.io**
2. Click "**New Project**"

### **STEP 2: Switch to Devnet**

1. Look at the bottom-left of Playground
2. Click where it says "**Localnet**" or "**Mainnet**"
3. Select "**Devnet**"

**‚úÖ Confirm you're on Devnet!**

### **STEP 3: Get Some SOL**

In the Playground terminal, type:
```bash

```

Wait for confirmation, then check balance:
```bash
solana balance
```

You should see ~2 SOL.

**‚úÖ Confirm you have SOL!**

### **STEP 6: Deploy to Devnet**

In the Playground terminal, type:
```bash

```

Wait for deployment (~10-20 seconds).

**Expected output:**
```
Program Id: ABC123...XYZ789
```

**‚úÖ COPY THAT PROGRAM ID AND SEND IT TO ME!**

### **STEP 7: Download the Compiled Program**

On your local computer (PowerShell), run:
```bash
solana program dump [PROGRAM_ID] analos-price-oracle.so --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
