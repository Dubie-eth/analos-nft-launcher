## 🔑 About GitHub Access

The builder will need to push to YOUR GitHub (Dubie-eth). You have 3 options:

### Option A: Give Temporary Access
- Share GitHub credentials for this task
- They create repo and push
- You change password after

### Option B: You Do The Git Push
- Builder creates the repo
- YOU run the git push commands (2 min)
- Builder runs verification commands

### Option C: Add As Collaborator
- You create the repo
- Add builder as collaborator
- They push and verify

**I recommend Option B** - You push (easy!), they verify (technical).

## 💡 Pro Tip

**Test with just Program #1 first!**

Tell builder:
"Do just the NFT Launchpad program first. If that works and shows verified on explorer, then do the other 8."

This way:
- Less risk
- Can troubleshoot one program
- Builds confidence
- Then batch the rest
