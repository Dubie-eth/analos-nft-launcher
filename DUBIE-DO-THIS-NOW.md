## ü§î Questions?

**Q: Do I need to do all 9 programs?**  
A: Start with just the NFT Launchpad (Program #1). If that works, I'll help you do the other 8!

**Q: What if it fails?**  
A: That's OK! Your program is still working fine. The verification just might not match 100% because it was built differently before. We can rebuild it properly later.

**Q: Can the other builder do this?**  
A: Sure! You can give them these commands. But you can totally do this yourself - it's just copy-pasting!

## üö® If You Get Stuck

**Git push fails?**
- Make sure you created the GitHub repo
- Make sure it's PUBLIC
- Try: `git remote -v` to see if remote is added

**Verification fails?**
- Make sure code is pushed to GitHub first
- Check you used the right commit hash
- The program might not match perfectly (that's OK for now!)

**Can't install solana-verify?**
- Make sure Rust is installed: `rustc --version`
- Try: `cargo install solana-verify --force`

---

**Ready? Just copy those 3 command blocks! üöÄ**
